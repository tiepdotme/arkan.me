This project was written entirely in JavaScript and p5.js framework. I was not really a fan of JavaScript before, used JQuery in the past for simple animations or AJAX requests, but never completely dived in the concept.

You can draw stuff on the canvas, add stickers, use effects, put shapes etc. This is a very limited version of Microsoft Paint.
