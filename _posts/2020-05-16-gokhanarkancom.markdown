I have been recently advised to use a personal landing page so people can find me easily since I don't use social media much. I took this opportunity to try Vue.js as I wanted to apply this to something for a long time.

This is my personal landing page built with Vue.js and hosted with Netlify. The contact form is integrated with AWS Lambda and Node.js.

I will style this page similar to Edward Tufte's handouts. [Check here](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) for more.

I know I am not really talented with picking a colour palette.
