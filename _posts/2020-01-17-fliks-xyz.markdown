This is a simple Flask app that I built for myself. I needed something minimal and straightforward to search for things.
There is also a What's New section to check the latest releases on Netflix. 
The app runs on Heroku and checks with multiple API's to serve the content.

I am caching some information on Redis to avoid making multiple API calls.

**Update 1**
OK. I hear some of the feedback. What's New part is now giving the information based on your IP address. I also added the country list dropdown.

**Update 2**
The search bar now stores the previous search. Thanks for the feedback stranger.

**Update 3**
IP feature is completed for across services too. It now works everywhere in the app.

The ```app/functions/instance/config.py``` is storing the credentials (it's the only file missing from this repo), for which services I use feel free to drop me a line.
